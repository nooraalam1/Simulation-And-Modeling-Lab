What I Learned

Generating normal distributions in Python: Using numpy.random.normal() to simulate real-world datasets.
Performing a two-sample t-test: Using scipy.stats.ttest_ind() to compare two independent sample means.
Interpreting statistical results: Understanding t-statistic, p-value, and hypothesis testing decisions.
Data visualization with Matplotlib: Plotting histograms to compare the distributions graphically.
Practical application of hypothesis testing: Learning how hypothesis tests are used in real-world data analysis and decision-making.
